My first high school web programming jobs.
My beginnings in programming!
These files are an endearing part of my journey into the world of coding. Created back in 2017 during my time in high school at Francisco Cannett Meza #4, these programs represent my first steps in web programming.
About the projects.
This small collection includes some of my early work, where I dabbled with HTML and JavaScript to create simple web-based programs. My final project was a grade calculator.
